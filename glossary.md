***
**location-based method:** method for quantifying GHG emissions based on average energy generation emission factors for defined geographic locations, including local, subnational, or national boundaries
***
**market-based method:** method for quantifying GHG emissions based on GHG emissions emitted by the generators from which the reporting entity contractually purchases electricity bundled with instruments, or unbundled instruments on their own
***
**marginal carbon intensity:** measurement of the carbon emissions associated with changes in electricity demand, representing the emissions from the specific power source that responds to fluctuations in demand
***
**power purchase agreement (PPA):** - long-term contract between an electricity producer and a buyer where the buyer agrees to purchase energy at a predetermined price for a specified time period
***
**power usage effectiveness (PUE):** ratio of the total amount of energy used by a data center facility to the energy delivered to computing equipment
***
**renewable energy credit REC:** market-based instrument that represents the property rights to the environmental, social, and other non-power attributes of renewable electricity generation
***
**water usage effectiveness WUE:** metric that assesses the water efficiency of a data center, measured as liters of water used per kilowatt-hour of energy consumed
