## Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)
Power usage effectiveness (PUE) is a metric used to determine a data center's energy efficiency. It is determined by dividing the total amount of power entering a data center by the power used to run the IT equipment.<br>
Ref: [Power Usage Effectiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_usage_effectiveness)

##  Water Effectiveness (WUE)
WUE is the ratio between the use of water in data centre systems (water loops, adiabatic towers, humidification, etc.) and the energy consumption of the IT equipment. The lower a data center's WUE ratio is, the more efficient it's use of water resources is. <br>
